## ###   Here, some questions to be answered for understanding the game:
#
#       Question: How is the fish rotation angle calculated?
#
#       If the fish's y velocity is 0, the the angle is 90°   
#       If the fish's y velocity is less than 0 (Going up), then the angle is the velocity is 90 divided by (velocity squared times ROTATION_SPEED), a cuadratic function where ROTATION_SPEED is the amplitude
#       If the fish's y velocity is more than 0 (Going down), then the angle is same formula from before plus 90°



#       Question: How does gravity work?
#
#       Each physics object (Objects from a PhysicsObject class' inherited class, which means they have speed, gravity and position)
#       Has a different speed and, depending on is class, different particular attributes.
#       The program takes each one of these objects and increases their y velocity as per their gravity attribute



#       Question: How do hitboxes work?
#
#       The three dimensional array of hitboxes stores a number of arrays
#       each one of these array store two more arrays (That's why it's "three dimensional")
#       these two arrays represent the coordinates of what are
#       -> The position of the top left corner of the hitbox
#       -> And ints size
#       Using this values, the game checks later on for each one of the moving objects on-screen and each one of the hitboxes if they have collided

# Imported required modules
from source.sources import *

# Simple keyboard layout:

KEYS = [
    pygame.K_UP,    #0 for jumping
    pygame.K_RIGHT, #1 for going right
    pygame.K_LEFT   #2 for going left
]



# Starting pygame
pygame.init()


# Basic constant for finding assets in the filesystem
# (while still keeping the code easy to read and modify)
MATERIALSDIR = "materiales/"





# These work very well for easily managing hitboxes
PELICAN_SIZE = [75, 59,4]
PELICAN_SIZE_COEFFICENT = PELICAN_SIZE[0]/48 # Because the sprite of the pelican is 48 pixels width
# Take into accout that the height of the pelican is 71,25
# This number was decided because the sprite has 38 pixels of height
# This is around 1 pixel of height for each 1,3 of width
# Same proportion is applied here.
# This is so that the pelican works in game as we intended it when using the sprite





## Here, the screen:

# Uncomment for a fullscreen window
#SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((0,0), pygame.FULLSCREEN)
#SCREEN_SIZE = SCREEN.get_size()

# Uncomment for a window of half the screen width
#del SCREEN
#SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_SIZE[0]/2, SCREEN_SIZE[1]))
#del SCREEN_SIZE
#SCREEN_SIZE = SCREEN.get_size()

# Uncomment for a custom window size
#del SCREEN
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((1000, 650))
#del SCREEN_SIZE
SCREEN_SIZE = SCREEN.get_size()
